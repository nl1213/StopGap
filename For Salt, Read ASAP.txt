Hey there, SaltWaterHippo.

I noticed your rant in senate chat today (12/27/2020), and I just wanted to let you know, I tried to help as best as I could. I suggested a potential build battle plugin, I helped make the SG map halfway playable, and I built the lobby for it. I'm sorry if my help isn't appreciated or if it wasn't enough, but I was stricken by you popping off, because I did everything you told me to do.

If you don't want to work with me, that's fine. Just let me know. And likewise, if you ever need help, all you need to do is reach out.

I'm sorry I wasn't at the minigames event.
